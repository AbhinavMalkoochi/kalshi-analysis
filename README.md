Kalshi Market Terminal is a Next.js + Convex + Clerk app that provides market discovery, detailed market views, and on-demand AI analysis.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in this folder and set the following variables:

- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
- CLERK_SECRET_KEY
- CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL (generated by `npx convex dev`)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL (generated by `npx convex dev`)

Convex creates .env.local automatically when you run:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

Then add your Clerk values to that file. Convex needs the Clerk JWT issuer domain from your Clerk "convex" JWT template.

## Convex

From the project root (this folder):

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This keeps your Convex functions synced while you develop.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
